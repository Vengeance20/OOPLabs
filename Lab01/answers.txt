2.2.5
  Input two numbers and calculate using operations: +, -, *, / and consider the case when calculating quotient with denominator of 0

2.2.6
  Considering ax + b = 0:
    Case 1: a != 0 => x = -b/a
    Case 2: a = 0
      +) b = 0 => Infinite solutions
      +) b != 0 => No solutions

  Considering system a_11 + a_12 = b1
                     a_21 + a_22 = b2
    Calculating the determiants:
      D = a_11 * b2 - a_21 * b1
      D1 = a_22 * b1 - a_12 * b2
      D2 = a_11 * b_2 - a_21 * b1
    Case 1: D != 0 => x1 = D/D1, x2 = D/D2
    Case 2: D = 0 and D1 or D2 != 0 => No solutions
    Case 3: D = D1 = D2 = 0 => Infinite solutions

  Considering Ax^2 + Bx + C
    Case 1: A = 0 => Similar to solving first-degree equation
    Case 2: A != 0
      Calculating delta
        +) delta > 0 => x = (-b +- sqrt(delta))/2a
        +) delta = 0 => x = -b/2a
        +) delta < 0 => No solutions
6.3
  Calling n = height of the triangle
  Each line has 2*i + 1 stars starting from i = 0 at the top of the triangle to i = n (bottom of the triangle)

6.4
  Creating arrays to check for validity of month input 
  After the input is valid, we check which month and year to output the number of days of that month

6.5
  Sort the array and using loop to calculate the sum and then the average

6.6
  Adding two matrices by using multi-dimensional array and loop
