2.2.5
  Input two numbers and calculate using operations: +, -, *, / and consider the case when calculating quotient with denominator of 0

2.2.6
  Considering ax + b = 0:
    Case 1: a != 0 => x = -b/a
    Case 2: a = 0
      +) b = 0 => Infinite solutions
      +) b != 0 => No solutions

6.3
  Calling n = height of the triangle
  Each line has 2*i + 1 stars starting from i = 0 at the top of the triangle to i = n (bottom of the triangle)

6.4
  Creating arrays to check for validity of month input 
  After the input is valid, we check which month and year to output the number of days of that month

6.5
